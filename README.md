Understanding Our Telecom Data: Subscription & Usage

In any telecom business, knowing who your customers are and how they use your services is key. That’s exactly what our two core tables track: Subscription and UsageRecord.

1. Subscription:
Think of a subscription as a customer’s personal account with your service. Each subscription links a customer to a specific service—like a SIM card, internet plan, or SMS bundle. It’s the foundation: without it, there’s no record of usage.

2. UsageRecord:
Every action a customer takes is tracked here. Did they make a call? Send an SMS? Use mobile data? Each of these activities is recorded with details like how much they used, when, for how long, and at what cost. It’s the heartbeat of customer activity and helps businesses understand usage patterns, billing, and service performance.

Example:
Ali has a SIM subscription. One day he:

Calls a friend for 5 minutes

Sends 1 SMS

Uses 500 MB of data

All these actions are logged in the UsageRecord table, linked back to Ali’s subscription.

✅ In short:

Subscription = the account

UsageRecord = everything happening in that account
